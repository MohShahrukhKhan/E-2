In Java, we have two types of relationship:

Is-A relationship-->Whenever one class inherits another class, it is called an IS-A relationship.
Has-A relationship--> Whenever an instance of one class is used in another class, it is called HAS-A relationship.



package abcpackage;

public class Addition {
   /* Since we didn't mention any access modifier here, it would
    * be considered as default.
    */
   int addTwoNumbers(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
   }
}


class ABC{  
    private double num = 100;
    private int square(int a){
     return a*a;
    }
 }  
 public class Example{
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     ABC obj = new ABC();  
     System.out.println(obj.num); 
     System.out.println(obj.square(10));
    }  
 }
 Protected data member and method are only accessible by the classes of the same package and the subclasses present in any package
 // protected
 package abcpackage;
public class Addition {

   protected int addTwoNumbers(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
   }
}
The members, methods and classes that are declared public can be accessed from anywhere
//this time the method addTwoNumbers() has public modifier and class Test is able to access this method without even extending the Addition class
package abcpackage;

public class Addition {

   public int addTwoNumbers(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
   }
}
